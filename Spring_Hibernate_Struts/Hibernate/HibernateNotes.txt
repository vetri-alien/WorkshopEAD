	Hibernate is an Object-Relational  Mapping(ORM) solution for JAVA.  		It is  an open source persistent framework created by Gavin King in 2001.
	It is a powerful, high performance Object-Relational Persistence and Query service for any Java Application.
	Hibernate  maps  Java  classes  to  database  tables  and  from  Java  data  types  to  SQL  data types  and  relieves  the  developer  from  95%  of  common  data  persistence  related programming tasks.
	Hibernate sits between traditional Java objects and database server to handle all the works in persisting those objects based on the appropriate O/R mechanisms and patterns.

Hibernate Advantages
	1) Hibernate  takes  care  of  mapping Java  classes  to  database  tables  using  XML  files and without writing any line of code.
	2) Provides  simple  APIs  for  storing  and  retrieving  Java  objects  directly  to  and  from the database.
	3) If there is change in the  database or in any table,  then  you need to change the  XML file properties only.
	4) Hibernate does not require an application server to operate.
	5) Manipulates Complex associations of objects of your database.
	6) Minimizes database access with smart fetching strategies.
	7) Provides simple querying of data.
